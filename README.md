# Welcome to my GitHub page :)

## Why did I make this page?
I made this page to help document everything I do when it comes to the cybersecurity field. Every project I make/work on personally will be documented about on this page.
The more I learn about GitHub and security in general, the better my page will become. This is my dream career and I will do whatever it takes to break out in it. :)
